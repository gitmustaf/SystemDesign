# Design Patterns

- Thumb rules or different concepts using which you can solve a problem of modelling real world example into object oriented design.

## Types of design patterns

- We can divide design patterns by its purpose or by its scope.
  
  - Purpose: What is the purpose any design pattern solves. Farther according to purpose we can divide into three types(Creational, Structural, Behavioral).

    - Creational: Used for creating or instantiating objects and classes.
    - Structural: Used for structuring more than one classes or objects.
    - Behavioral: Used for identifying and setting up common communication patterns among objects.
  
  - Scope: Scope of the pattern Class or Object.

  |           | **Object**| Abstract Factory| Adaptor(Object)| Chain of responsibility      |

  |           |           | Prototype       | Composite      | Iterator                     |
  |           |           | Singleton       | Decorator      | Mediator                     |
  |           |           |                 | Facade         | Memento                      |
  |           |           |                 | Flyweight      | Observer                     |
  |           |           |                 | Proxy          | State                        |
  |           |           |                 |                | Strategy                     |
